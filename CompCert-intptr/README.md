# CompCert
The formally-verified C compiler.

## Overview
The CompCert C verified compiler is a compiler for a large subset of the
C programming language that generates code for the PowerPC, ARM, x86 and
RISC-V processors.

The distinguishing feature of CompCert is that it has been formally
verified using the Coq proof assistant: the generated assembly code is
formally guaranteed to behave as prescribed by the semantics of the
source C code.

For more information on CompCert (supported platforms, supported C
features, installation instructions, using the compiler, etc), please
refer to the [Web site](https://compcert.org/) and especially
the [user's manual](https://compcert.org/man/).

## CompCertSSA version

This development is a version of CompCert extended with an SSA
middle-end:

- construction of the SSA form, from RTL
- SSA-based optimizations
- SSA-related librairies on dominance and dominators
- SSA destruction with coalescing, on the Conventional SSA form

The following people contibuted to this extension (alphabetic order):
Sandrine Blazy, Delphine Demange, Yon Fernandez de Retana, David
Pichardie, LÃ©o Stefanesco.

## CompCertCast

This development is a version that supports CompCert integer-pointer casting. 
For detailed explanations, please refer to the README in the parent directory and the paper.

## Difference

If you want to check the modifications we made while developing CompCertCast, you can refer to CompCertCast.patch.
The patch includes differences in Coq development and other compiler development between CompCertSSA and CompCertCast,
but does not include additional binaries (e.g., ccomp_orig) and scripts (e.g., test_compare.sh) added for tests.
